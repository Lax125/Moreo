Any good social media advert should leave a positive impression of the brand in the viewer's mind, so it feels more "friendly" to them when they go shopping. My advert for Oreos catches the user's attention with a "demo mode" that shows what you can do with it: make custom Oreo cookies and watch as the cookies and cream fly into a glass of milk one-by-one. The eye-catching animations of falling cookies and cream coupled with humourous names of the monstrous cookies (e.g. "REOOOOREOOOREREREOOREO") should leave a positive impression of Oreos in the viewer's mind. When the viewer clicks on the advert, control of the buttons is handed over to them so they can start making any cookie and cream sequence they like. This gives the viewer a sense of agency and a desire to do the same with real Oreo cookies. The blue background and thick font is on-brand for Oreos, and for good reason: the user should be reminded of the sketch when they see a box of Oreos at the supermarket. Two minor concerns:

- Commercial: This could count as false advertising because it's impossible to fully separate an Oreo.
- Ethical: Oreo's aren't the most healthy snack choice.
